I grew up in a small town called Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia. I really like to tinker with computer since I was a child. Playing games (SkiFree to Age of Empires II) in my dad\u0026rsquo;s office computer, then learn some office softwares, buying a floppy disk to save my diary (encrypted with Webdings font!), buying PC magazines, leads to learn how to assemble my own computer and do an OS install. That was a good time!\nLong story short, I decide to take an Information Technology major in my local university then got accepted in my first company right after graduated, working as a mobile application developer. Since then, it is already 7 years I work as a software developer and now I\u0026rsquo;m a part of a software house startup company.\nI never really write anything in my 7 years journey and I feel kinda regretted it. So I decide to create this blog, where I can write anything I found interesting. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a coding-related thing, technology heads up, or maybe just my random thought. Feel free read and share!\nA bunch of code here Bonus This is a cat from my work, maybe someday she can be a good software tester to find mice bugs from my code.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/welcome/","summary":"Introduction Hi there!
