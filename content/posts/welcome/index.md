## Introduction


Hi there! I'm Dhemas, an Indonesian software engineer. I grew up in a small town called Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia. I really like to tinker with computer since I was a child. Playing games (SkiFree to Age of Empires II) in my dad's office computer, then learn some office softwares, buying a floppy disk to save my diary (encrypted with Webdings font!), buying PC magazines, leads to learn how to assemble my own computer and do an OS install. That was a good time!

Long story short, I decide to take an Information Technology major in my local university then got accepted in my first company right after graduated, working as a mobile application developer. Since then, it is already 7 years I work as a software developer and now I'm a part of a software house startup company.

I never really write anything in my 7 years journey and I feel kinda regretted it. So I decide to create this blog, where I can write anything I found interesting. Maybe it's a coding-related thing, technology heads up, or maybe just my random thought. Feel free read and share!


## Bonus


This is a cat from my work, maybe someday she can be a good software tester to find ~~mice~~ bugs from my code.
